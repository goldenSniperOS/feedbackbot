### Status Quo
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [`TailwindCSS`](https://tailwindcss.com). It currently uses [`next-auth`](https://next-auth.js.org) for authentication, [`firebase`](https://firebase.google.com) to store data in a firestore database.

We'll gonna use [`NLP`](https://github.com/axa-group/nlp.js)

### Soon 
Some AI-tool (likely NLP) will come in handy for the automated interpretation and maybe visualation of the feedback data. There are also plans to use order #'s for login when in prod so that no accounts are needed in the future.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
Login
